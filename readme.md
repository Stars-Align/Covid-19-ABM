# Epodemiology Agent-based Model Simulator
The project aims to demonstrate the agent-based simulator used for modeling epidemiology. The basic idea of this simulator comes from a 3Blue1Brown video on modeling particles as agents to simuate spread of epidemic.

The demo works as a prototype to demonstrate our modeling method. The same modeling method is used to model real world disease transmitting in a metropols environment.

# More About the Research Project

Our project aims to simulate how an pandemic spread in real world by propagating the idea in this web demo to real world context. On a metropolis level, we generate synthetic population and their traveling schedule based on traffic demand models. Several assumptions of disease transmittion are made. The goal is to see how the disease spreads over the days in a simulation. By comparing simulation results and real world data during the Covid-19, we can evaluate the performance of our model in predicting situations and find statistics evidence to support this model. By using this agent-based model, not only can we predict the numbers like the infected patients over time, but we can also evaluate the effectiveness of different countermeasures, which is useful for both public awareness and helping governments to measure the effectiveness of disease control.
